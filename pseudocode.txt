pi sends ASK READY
arduino sends READY
pi receives READY

for all chunks stored in pi
    pi sends **chunk data** starting with ^ ending with $
    arduino parses non-chunk commands
        if arduino gets ASK READY
            send READY
        if arduino gets START CHUNK
            set internal flag inChunk to true
    pi listens for RECEIVED CHUNK DATA
        pi stores **chunk data**
    pi sends START CHUNK
    arduino receives START CHUNK
    arduino parses chunk commands line by line through stored **chunk data**
        if line is DONE:
            free memory
            arduino sends ALL CHUNKS DONE
        elif line is END CHUNK
            set internal flag inChunk to false
        elif line is SET ORIGIN
            set current position for all motors
        elif line is motor movement step values (line starts with @)
            stepper.move() for all steppers to STEP values
            block with while loop for stepper.run()
    arduino frees memory
    arduino sends REQUEST NEXT CHUNK
    pi receives REQUEST NEXT CHUNK
    pi sends **chunk data**
